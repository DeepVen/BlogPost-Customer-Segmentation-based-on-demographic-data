## Overview

In this project, we are provided with demographic data of customers of a mail-order company in Germany and demographic data of general population of Germany. Using this data, we answer following questions.

1. Is high volume of features in dataset always means more information to make better prediction?
2. From the general demographic data, is it possible to identify hidden patterns or grouping in data?
3. In Clusters, does Features have same weights across all clusters or different clusters have different weights?
4. Out of 366 features in the dataset, is it possible to identify any 1 feature that is most important to make prediction?
